# Machine learning from scratch, using numpy

An effort to implement machine learning stuff from scratch. In order to maybe learn a thing or two!

*Note:* This isn't meant to be a full stack with training/validation/testing, it's just a personal foray into ML-algorithms.

## Currently implemented:

- Neural network (linear/sigmoid/relu layers)
